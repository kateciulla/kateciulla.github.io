     <p2>Air Hockey</p2>
    <br>
     <p>The game we created was air hockey. 
        We wanted to create a game that we both knew and make it so we could play it on a computer.
        The point of the game is to hit the puck into the opposite goal. You are also playing against a computer that is going to randomly move around their half of the board.
        You, the red paddle, are trying to hit the puck in to the computers,blue paddle, goal.
        In order for you to win the game, you have to score 5 points. But you could also lose to the computer if it scores 5 goals on you.
